				The Python Mauritius User Group (pymug) is the local Python user group
				of Mauritius. Our aim is to provide opportunities to everybody to upskill
				their level of Python and to ease industry-adoption of Python-related technologies. 
				A nice overview of the User Group can be found on the MSCC website
				<a href="https://www.mscc.mu/python-mauritius-usergroup-pymug/">here</a>.
				To sum it up, we care about Python education. Our website: <a href="https://www.pymug.com">pymug.com</a>

				We'll be present at the DevCon which is an amazing community-driven
				event.

				The Pymug organises year-round events. Topic days, meetups, from scratch
				sessions as well as University topic coverage. Have a look at our
